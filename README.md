This repository holds code that simulates an autonomous shopping robot using Webots and ROS.  Since our robot is intended to faciliate fully autonomous shopping in retail stores it will need to simultaneously perform pick and place actions as well as move to locations where the target obstacles are within reach.  To do this, the robot will need some vision capabilities, and knowledge of the Forward and Inverse Kinematics of its actuator.  The code in this repository will accomplish both of these tasks.

We decided to structure our project as a ros package, similar to those in lab, so that we can use a procedure similar to the one in lab to work on our code.  This package is called ece470 and is found in the root directory.  Our simulation worlds can be found in the /worlds directory and launch file in ece470.launch file.
